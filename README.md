# Tubestr

## An Open Source Video Platform Combining LBRY and Nostr

Tubestr is an open source video platform that integrates two decentralized open source protocols: [LBRY](https://lbry.tech/overview), that handles the video database, and [nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr?tab=readme-ov-file) for the social media layer with its relays.

## Motivation

Nostr allows users to immigrate to other applications without social data loss, such as followers, engagement metrics and monetary donations. LBRY removes the necessity of hosting an expensive central database.
